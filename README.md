iPhone app that solves a Linear Diophantine Equation

A Linear Diophantine Equation is expressed in the form Ax + By = C.
Where A, B, C are given integers and x, y are integers we're
trying to find so that the equation is satisfied.

The characteristic of the Linear Diophantine Equation is that
there are either no solutions or an infinite amount of solutions.

A Linear Diophantine Equation has no integer solutions when
C mod GCD(A,B) != 0

Or more plainly, the greatest common denominator of A and B does
not divide C.

Otherwise an infinite number of solutions can be generated by
running the Extended Euclidian Algorithm followed by the following
rules.

x = (X*C-B*n)/GCD(A,B);
y = (Y*C+A*n)/GCD(A,B);

where X and Y is a particular solution to the equation given by
Extended Euclidian Algorithm and n is an integer.

Why do we want to solve Linear Diophantine Equations?

Suppose a farmer owns many of chickens and rabbits and he tells
you there is a total of 24 legs in the pen.

How many chickens and rabbits does he own?

This problem can be expressed using a Linear Diophantine Equation

2x + 4y = 24

Where there are x two legged chickens and y four legged rabbits
for a total of 24 legs.

This application runs the Extended Euclidian Algorithm and
determines that

x = (12) - 2(n)
y = (0) + 1(n)

evaluating the solutions for n in {1,6} we get.

n=1  2(10) + 4(1) = 24 // 10 Chickens, 1 rabbit
n=2  2(8) + 4(2) = 24
n=3  2(6) + 4(3) = 24  // 6 Chickens, 3 rabbits
n=4  2(4) + 4(4) = 24  
n=5  2(2) + 4(5) = 24  // 2 Chickens, 5 rabbits
n=6  2(0) + 4(6) = 24

Are all possible solutions to this problem
